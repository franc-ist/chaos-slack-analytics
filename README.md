Through managing a Slack workspace for my university society, I have found some of the analytics provided by the workspace dashboard to be a bit lacklustre. This bot aims to fix that.

The project is driven by a need to check when members of my committee were last online, so I can check if they are seeing important information, and chase them up elsewhere if need be.
